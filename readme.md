This is an archive for project's i don't work on any longer. 

Projects: 

* project_tester(2015-2016): Was an attempt to hand craft a REST Backend in Java. Used Maven, Hibernate, Spring and Spring Security. Would not approach a task like this anymore. But i learned a lot.

* timemaster(2018): An attempt to create a time tracking script with powershell. Switched to python for this.
