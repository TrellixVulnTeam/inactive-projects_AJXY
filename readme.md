This is an archive for project's i don't work on any longer. 

Projects: 

* **project_tester(2015-2016):** Was an attempt to hand craft a REST Backend in Java. Used Maven, Hibernate, Spring and Spring Security. Would not approach a task like this anymore. But i learned a lot.

* **ps-timemaster(2018):** An attempt to create a time tracking script with powershell. Switched to python for this.

* **py-timemaster(2019-2020):** A python timetracker. Moved on to other things, but might pick this up again. 

* **static-site-generator(2020):** Wanted to create my own static site generator to setup my own blog. The project lost some steam when it came to finetuning the html files. Started blogging on dev.to instead. (https://dev.to/taijidude)
