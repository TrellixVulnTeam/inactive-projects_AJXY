# Python time tracking

This is an old attempt at a commandline time tracking app. I think i might pick this up again. Here are my Ideas to revieve this: 

* Make it way less complex. Throw out the OR Mapper and to whole SQLite Stuff. Use a Json File for persistence. 
* Don't do all the formating for the cli on my own --> Use a lib for this? Is there a lib? 
* Is there a better cli lib? Research this
